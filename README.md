# VQ-VAE

This is a PyTorch implementation of the VQ-VAE model as described in the paper "Neural Discrete Representation Learning" by van den Oord et al. (2017) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00937).

The dataset used is FashionMNIST, which is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
